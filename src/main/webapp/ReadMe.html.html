# Welcome to Class room Attendance System Project  #

Thanks to perscholas for giving me this opportunity.This was a great learning experience  to me  taught by my instructors Leon,Haseeb regarding the in-depth java programming knowledge.Thanks to their continuous support in training as a full-stack java software developer.

## ***Project Objective:*** ##

-  Teacher can track the presence of a student by taking attendance and mark him in the school records. 
-  Teacher/Student can create personal account to access this application at any time.
-  Student can login and update personal details along with parent email ID.

### ***User Stories*** ###

User stories are created in [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US). You have to create an account in Trello.com to access user stories and access to project in Trello. You can access [wireframes](https://github.com/LakshmiBulusu/attendancesystem_mvc_project/blob/master/classroomattendancesystem-wireframes.pdf).

###   ***How to download and run this application:***
####  Part 1 - Assumptions made/Key points:- ####

This is my first full stack java project and started with defining requirements, wireframes, design,coding and testing for an entire application. I'm planned to improve further to add more Junit test cases, UI validations and will be adding more documentation.

To run application successfully, please note down below key assumptions. 

- For every successful request system forwards user to Home page/Index page. 
- For any error system forwards to an error page. 
- User has to create an account first before any operation.
- After teacher successful login, system forwards to attendance page with populated student details.     
- After student successful login, system forwards to student details page.    
 

####  Part 2 - Clone the project ####
* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Intellij, for example).
* Create a Database "attendance_system" using SQL in "\dev\attendancesystem_mvc_project\src\main\resources\createdatabase-attedancesystem.sql" 
* Create Tables using SQL in "\dev\attendancesystem_mvc_project\src\main\resources\createtable-attedancesystem.sql"  
* Populate student details using SQL in "\dev\attendancesystem_mvc_project\src\main\resources\populate_studentdetails.sql"
		   

####  Part 3 - Run the project ####
* The project/module name is defined as 'attendancesystem'.
* Begin building the project/module based on code editor(ex: Build module 'attendancesystem' project in Intellij)
* Check your JDK version is same as in .pom.xml. If you have different version then    update JDK version in pom.xml.
* RunTomcat :run application
* Access application:http://localhost:8080/classattendance/
